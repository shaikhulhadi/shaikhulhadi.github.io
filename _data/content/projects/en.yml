      post: |
        Under BUET-Energypac Research Collaboration HEQEP Sub-Project CP#3817 , We worked on designing a Digital 
        Controller IC for LED driver circuit. Purpose of this IC is to replace Analog controller circuit in Boost
        controller to increase longevity and reduce cost of LED driver circuit for Solar Home System use.
        
        180nm technology based BUET VLSI standard cell library is used for this design. A hybrid architecture is
        followed. First spin fabrication is completed and testing bring out some mismatch issues with IO pad provided by Europractice IC service.
        Next step modification includes designing own IO pad . There is also some scope to improve clock speed, high resolution ADC design and DFT implementation.

        TSMC 180nm technology based 7 track standard cells.

        This cell library contains 50 standard cells which can be used to design
        full digital circuits. It also contains three special analog cells for mix-signal 
        design purpose. This cells are used to design BUET LED driver controller circuit.
        
        All standard cell designs are characterized using Liberate and Abstract Generator of Cadence.

        Technical analysis on RedAlert(N13V) ransomware that targets VMWare ESXi servers running on Windows and Linus platform.
        Static and Dynamic analysis of malware was performed to gain insight on how the malware works to collect data from the victim. 
        Also indipendent analysis examined how those data is distributed in deep web. [[pdf](/assets/pdf/A_Technical_Analysis_of_RedAlert_Ransomware.pdf){:target="_blank"}]

        Here I analyzed public sentiment for a company stock based on relevant news headlines using Natural Language 
        Toolkit (nltk) library. For each headline, relevant tweets also collected and analyzed for public sentiment 
        to re-evaluate overall public sentiment towards the stock. Due to significant adoption of social media, how each 
        headline is accepted in social media and how viral it become may give us more accurate public sentiment analysis 
        of a particular stock. [[pdf](/assets/pdf/sentiment_analysis_report.pdf){:target="_blank"}]

        8 bit register microprocessor with 64Kbit memory capability, designed in Proteus simulation software. 
        This was single bus architecture processor to perform basic SAP2 microprocessor 
        commands along with PUSH and POP function (in total 16 instruction set predetermined by instructor). 
        Temporary register was optimized and ideal cycle of IR was utilized as temporary memory 
        element. 
        
        To provide user easy way to insert instruction code, A compiler was also designed in C++
        to convert assembly code to hex output to upload in simulated memory.

        This is a asynchronous arithmetic logic unit bit wise design using Cadence Design Suite . 
        This circuit could perform 12 predefined opcode based operation both logical and arithmetical. 
        Total design required only 502 MOSFET as  one of the major concern was to optimized design area.  
        Total layout have to be designed manually as requirement. [[pdf](/assets/pdf/4Bit_Arethmatic_Logic_Unit.pdf){:target="_blank"}]
